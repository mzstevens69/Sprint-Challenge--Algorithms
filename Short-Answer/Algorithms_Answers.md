#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) --it has the loop than is n 


b) O(n^n ) -- the outer loop is O(n) time -- the inner loop is doubling J everytime so as J grows exponentially.

c) O(n)  the return will be a linear operation by calling its self once for each iteration

## Exercise II

Taking the n story I would start in the middle(halving floors) of (n story). I would drop an egg, if it breaks I would halve the lower remaining n(story) and repeat the process of halving story and dropping egg from middle of the halved stories, if it doesn't break take the middle of the upper floors and drop and egg from there repeating the same steps. 

The runtime is O(log n) -- As it halves the inputs of the search every time.
